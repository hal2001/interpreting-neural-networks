# Interpreting neural networks
A few iPython notebooks on interpretation of neural networks

Begin with [part 1](https://github.com/jonbruner/interpreting-neural-networks/blob/2782973ae80ad8b395d9e85f710c940bcbea7b41/Fooling%20Neural%20Networks%20part%201.ipynb), which is the introductory narrative and overview, and then move on to [part 2](https://github.com/jonbruner/interpreting-neural-networks/blob/master/Fooling%20Neural%20Networks%20part%202.ipynb), which has code samples.
