# Interpreting neural networks
A few iPython notebooks on interpretation of neural networks

Begin with [part 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jonbruner/interpreting-neural-networks/blob/master/Fooling%20Neural%20Networks%20part%201.html), which is the introductory narrative and overview, and then move on to [part 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jonbruner/interpreting-neural-networks/blob/master/Fooling%20Neural%20Networks%20part%202.html), which has code samples.

I recommend viewing these in nbviewer (GitHub doesn't render output scrolling in Jupyter notebooks), but be sure to download the original .ipnb files to run on your own machine.
