# Interpreting neural networks
A few iPython notebooks on interpretation of neural networks

Begin with [part 1](https://www.jebruner.com/2017/06/interpreting-and-fooling-neural-networks-part-1/), which is the introductory narrative and overview, and then move on to [part 2](https://www.jebruner.com/2017/06/interpreting-and-fooling-neural-networks-part-2-with-code/), which has code samples.

I recommend viewing these [on my web site](https://www.jebruner.com/2017/06/interpreting-and-fooling-neural-networks-part-1/) (GitHub doesn't render output scrolling in Jupyter notebooks), but be sure to download the original .ipynb files to run on your own machine.
